# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
V. Isualize needs a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The DataFrame will be used to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. Pandas and Matplotlib are the main tools to utilize to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
