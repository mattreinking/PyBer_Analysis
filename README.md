# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
V. Isualize needs a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The DataFrame will be used to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. Pandas and Matplotlib are the main tools to be utilized to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Resources
Visual Studio Code  
Matplotlib  
Pandas  

## Results

Anaylsis Results:  
- Urban cities have the highest total in the Total Rides being more than double rural and suburban cities combined  
- Urban cities also dominate in the total Total Drivers category being more than 4x rural and suburban cities combined  
- Rural cities make the least money coming to a total of $4327.93 compared to urban cities making an astonishing $39,854.38  
- Rural cities do have highest Average Fare per Ride at $34.62 and Average Fare per Driver at $55.49

The line graph displays the Total Fare by City Type. Over the span of January to May, urban cities clearly generate the most revenue. Most likely, this is due to the volume of work that happens in urban cities. All three city types maintain a consistent average in total fare never surpassing and/or falling below one another. While urban cities do generate the the most fare, this does not reflect how much fare drivers make on average. Data points above show that while rural cities generate the least revenue, the drivers do make more money on average which is most likely due to longer routes between destinations.

## Summary

Business recommendations:  
1. Decrease the number of drivers in urban cities. There are 2405 drivers total while only having a total of 1625 rides. A large margin of drivers are not even able to complete one ride.  
2. Provide incentives to drivers in urban cities to take on more rides/take longer routes to boost the Average Fareper Driver and keep it competitive between all city types.  
3. This study was only calculated over a third of the year. It would be worth to conduct a study spanning the whole year to see how different seasons impact the statistics.
